```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular architecture:

- `app.py`: Main application entry point
- `train_model.py`: Script to train the chatbot model
- `data/`: Contains training data for the chatbot
- `models/`: Stores trained models and related files
- `src/`: Source code directory
  - `api/`: API endpoints
  - `nlp/`: NLP components
  - `utils/`: Utility modules
- `templates/`: Frontend templates

## Usage

### Basic Chat API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Where is my order?", "user_id": "CUST001"}'
```

### Order Tracking

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/orders/order/ORD12345
```

### Product Recommendations

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/recommendations/recommend \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "CUST001"}'
```

### Ticket Management

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/tickets/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"customer_id": "CUST001", "issue_type": "return", "description": "Customer wants to return defective item"}'
```

## Customization

### Adding New Intents

To add new intents, edit the `data/intents/intents.json` file:

```json
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "new_intent",
      "patterns": ["Pattern 1", "Pattern 2", "Pattern 3"],
      "responses": ["Response 1", "Response 2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

After adding new intents, retrain the model:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

### Integrating with Your CRM

Update the CRM integration settings in `src/utils/crm_integration.py` with your API credentials.
